# Aero Space Sound Wave Simulation Project

This repository contains a Python implementation of sound wave propagation using the 2D finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The project explores acoustic behavior in both simple and complex geometries, including time-dependent waveforms that simulate stylized speech.

## Features

- 2D FDTD solver for the acoustic wave equation
- Spatial and time-dependent source models (Gaussian, speech)
- Geometry masking with room cutouts and circular obstacles
- Visualization using 3×3 snapshot grids and real-time animations
- Speech waveform simulation: "heh - lo - there"

## Running

Each simulation file in `simulations/` can be run independently:

```bash
python simulations/pulse_in_box.py
```

Figures and animations will be saved to the appropriate folder inside `results/`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- matplotlib
- shapely

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Reproducibility

Wave speed, time step, and source locations are all controlled via local parameters in each simulation script. Output files are consistently written to the `results/` subdirectories, and visualizations are rendered using `matplotlib`.
