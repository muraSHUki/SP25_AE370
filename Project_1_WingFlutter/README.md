# Wing Flutter Simulation Project

This repository contains a Python implementation for simulating a two-degree-of-freedom aeroelastic wing flutter system. The project includes visualization, parameter sweeps, and solver comparisons using both fixed-step RK4 and adaptive RK45 integration methods.

## Features

- RK4 and RK45 ODE integration methods
- Max amplitude tracking vs. velocity
- Energy-based flutter detection
- Animation and frame capture of wing motion
- Convergence testing using relative error

## Running

Each file in `simulations/` can be run directly:

```bash
python simulations/flutter_simulation.py
```

Ensure `flutter_model.py` is in the same root directory.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- numpy
- matplotlib

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` if needed.

## Reproducibility

To keep results clean, output files and figures are saved to the `results/` directory. Animation is generated using `matplotlib.animation`.
